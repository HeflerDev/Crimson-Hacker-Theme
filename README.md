## Rubr0 Theme for Neovim

**Rubr0** is a focused, elegant Neovim colorscheme built for developers who value clarity, discipline, and aesthetic intensity. Inspired by the deep, powerful tones of red, Rubr0 channels that energy into a theme designed to enhance your focus and reduce visual clutterâ€”perfect for long coding sessions or moments of intense concentration.

### âœ¨ Features

* **All-red palette**: A unique range of red shades used with precision to avoid eye fatigue while maintaining a striking visual identity.
* **Tree-sitter support**: Carefully crafted highlight groups for modern syntax highlighting.
* **Minimal yet expressive**: Every color serves a purposeâ€”subtle for structure, bold for function.
* **UI-friendly**: Works smoothly with plugins like `nvim-tree`, `telescope.nvim`, `cmp`, and `lualine`.

### ðŸ“¸ Philosophy

Rubr0 isnâ€™t just a themeâ€”itâ€™s a mindset. It's the moment when the chaos of red becomes direction. A laser beam of attention in a world full of noise.

- This theme is a fork of the Gruvbox theme, it's meant for personal use, but feel free to use.
